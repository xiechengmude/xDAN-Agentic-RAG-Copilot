Abstract
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs)
to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have enabled LLMs
to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition
through multi-turn interactions with retrieval
engines. However, existing approaches either
optimize retrieval using search-only metrics
(e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or
fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and
retrieve—entangling retrieval with generation
and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In
this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, modelagnostic framework that decouples the searcher
from the generator and trains the searcher using
a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement
in generation accuracy over naïve RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform
baselines trained on over 70
× more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical
QA benchmarks.

1 Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables
large language models (LLMs) to access and reason over external knowledge by retrieving relevant documents and conditioning generation on
them (Lewis et al.
, 2020). As shown in Figure
2
,
we categorize the evolution of RAG systems into
three phases.
Classic RAG. Early approaches relied on static
retrieval methods, where queries were fixed and
retrieval quality was decoupled from downstream
generation performance. Despite their simplicity,
these systems often underperformed on queries that
need contextual or multi-hop reasoning. 1Code available at https://github.com/pat-jj/s3

Pre-RL-Zero. To improve retrieval quality, subsequent methods enabled more active participation of the LLM during inference. Active RAG
techniques (Yao et al.
, 2022
; Jiang et al.
, 2023
;
Trivedi et al.
, 2023a) interleaved query generation,
retrieval, and reasoning in a multi-turn loop. These
systems introduced iterative retrieval but typically
relied on zero-shot prompting and lacked trainable
components. Self-RAG (Asai et al.
, 2023) distilled
such behaviors from larger models into smaller
ones via supervised fine-tuning, teaching smaller
models to reason and retrieve effectively without
external rewards. While these methods improved
flexibility and reduced supervision cost, they still
did not optimize retrieval using outcome signals.

Figure 3: Decomposition of Agentic RAG. End-to-end approaches fine-tune the entire model using the entire generation
accuracy, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of
search. In contrast, s3 freezes the generator and trains only
the searcher with Gain Beyond RAG (GBR), a novel reward
that quantifies the added value of retrieved context over naïve
RAG, enabling modular, efficient optimization.
learning for retrieval marks a new phase—what
we refer to as the RL-Zero era. DeepSeek-R1-
Zero (Guo et al., 2025) showed that even rulebased, outcome-driven rewards (e.g., answer correctness) can train strong reasoning agents. Building on this idea, DeepRetrieval (Jiang et al., 2025)
applied RL to train query generators using searchoriented metrics like recall and NDCG. However,
these metrics are disconnected from downstream
answer quality. Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025) trained
a single model to jointly retrieve and generate via
reinforcement learning, using exact match (EM) as
the reward. While this approach improves answer
accuracy, the tight entanglement between search
and generation makes it difficult to isolate genuine
retrieval improvements (see Figure 3). Moreover,
EM is a brittle reward signal—failing to reward
semantically correct answers phrased differently.
This motivates a shift toward a modular framework where search and generation are cleanly separated, and optimization focuses purely on search
quality with respect to downstream utility (Dai
et al., 2025). We propose s3, a simple yet powerful
framework that trains a search-only agent using
a novel reward signal: Gain Beyond RAG (GBR).
GBR measures how much better the generator performs when conditioned on retrieved documents
from s3, compared to naive top-k retrieval. This
setup keeps the generator LLM frozen, sidesteps
answer token overfitting, and directly optimizes the
retrieval component to serve any black-box LLM.
Remarkably, s3 achieves strong gains with only
2.4k training examples, outperforming DeepRetrieval (focused on retrieval metrics) and Search-R1
(entangled optimization) both in terms of context
quality and final answer performance.
Our main contributions are:
• We introduce s3, a modular, RL-based search
framework that optimizes for generation quality
without touching the generator.
• We define Gain Beyond RAG (GBR), a principled, model-agnostic reward signal that quantifies improvements over standard retrieval.
• We show that s3 outperforms state-of-the-art
agentic RAG methods on six general and five
medical QA benchmarks, using 70× less training data (see Figure 1).

Figure 4: Overview of the s3 framework. The searcher iteratively generates queries, retrieves documents, and selects useful
documents until completion. The final context Ds3 is then passed to a frozen generator LLM. The searcher is trained using Gain
Beyond RAG (GBR), which quantifies improvement over naïve top-k retrieval from the original question.
(RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023) augments LLMs by prepending retrieved documents
to their input, enabling access to up-to-date or
domain-specific information. The effectiveness
of this setup, however, depends heavily on the
retrieval quality. Early efforts improve retrieval
through supervised query rewriting (Nogueira and
Cho, 2019; Lin et al., 2023a), where LLMs are
fine-tuned to generate better search queries from
manually labeled or distilled training data. These
methods require significant annotation effort and
often optimize for imitation rather than end-task
performance. Recent works have introduced Active RAG methods (Yao et al., 2022; Trivedi et al.,
2023a; Asai et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2024), which
prompt LLMs to iteratively retrieve and reason in a
zero-shot or few-shot manner. While flexible, these
methods typically rely on handcrafted prompting
patterns and lack direct optimization by interacting
with environment.
2.2 RL for Agentic Retrieval and
Searcher-Centric Optimization
The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) for
large language models has given rise to agentic
retrieval, where models interact with search engines and improve by receiving outcome-based
feedback—such as whether the final answer is correct. We refer to this shift as the RL-Zero period,
sparked by the insight that even simple rewards
like answer correctness can elicit strong reasoning
and search behavior (Guo et al., 2025). Within this
paradigm, retrieval-centric methods like DeepRetrieval (Jiang et al., 2025) optimize query generation for search metrics (e.g., recall, NDCG), which
often fail to reflect answer utility—i.e., whether the
retrieved context helps generate a correct answer.
Conversely, end-to-end approaches like SearchR1 (Jin et al., 2025) train LLMs to retrieve and
generate jointly using exact match rewards, but require full model access and entangle search with
answer token alignment.
In contrast, s3 takes a searcher-centric approach
that avoids generator fine-tuning. It directly optimizes retrieval quality using a generation-aware
reward, enabling lightweight and modular training
that is compatible with black-box LLMs.
3 s3: Optimized Search-Select-Serve
Flow with Reinforcement Learning
We introduce s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic
framework that equips a tunable search agent with
structured, multi-turn access to external knowledge.
As illustrated in Figure 4, the searcher LLM interacts with a search engine iteratively: it generates
queries, retrieves documents, selects a subset of
useful evidence, and decides whether to continue
searching. A frozen generator LLM then consumes
the accumulated evidence to produce a final answer. To ensure a fair reward baseline, s3 begins
by retrieving top-k (k = 3 in our experiments) documents from the original question, just like naïve
3
RAG. The searcher is trained using the Gain Beyond RAG (GBR) reward, which measures the improvement in generation accuracy when using its
retrieved context versus this baseline. This modular design enables targeted optimization of retrieval
quality, decoupled from answer generation.
3.1 Multi-Turn Search-Select Loop
Given a question Q, the system consists of (1) a
searcher LLM (policy) πs3, (2) a search engine R,
(3) a frozen generator LLM G.
s3 first retrieves top-k documents using q0 = Q,
yielding D0 = R(Q). A subset Dsel
0 ⊆ D0 is selected to form the initial context. It then performs
a sequence of search rounds t = 1, 2, . . . , T, structured as follows:
s3 Loop
1. Query Generation: The searcher emits a query
qt in <query>...</query>.
2. Search: Documents Dt = R(qt) are retrieved in
<information>...</information>
3. Select: Useful documents are selected between
<important_info>...</important_info>, corresponding to subset D
sel
t ⊆ Dt.
4. Stop decision: The model declares
<search_complete>[1/0]</search_complete>.
The loop continues until search_complete is True
(1) or the turn limit is reached. The final context is
Ds3 =
ST
t=0 Dsel
t
, which is passed (served) to the
generator to produce the final output:
Aˆ = G(Q, Ds3)
Initialization (Begin with Search). Initializing
with q0 = Q ensures the loop begins with the same
context as naïve RAG, making the Gain Beyond
RAG reward reflect true search improvements.
3.2 Training via Gain Beyond RAG (GBR)
To train πs3, we frame search as a reinforcement
learning problem. The reward signal, Gain Beyond
RAG (GBR), quantifies the improvement in generation accuracy over a fixed top-k baseline:
GBR(Q) = Acc(G(Q, Ds3), A)
− Acc(G(Q, DRAG), A) (1)
where A is the gold-standard answer, and DRAG =
R(Q) is the top-k retrieval from the original question. Acc(·) is a task-specific metric, which we
instantiate as Generation Accuracy (see §4.1) for
RAG performance.
This reward ensures the searcher is incentivized
to retrieve documents that meaningfully enhance
the generator’s output quality, independent of
surface-form answer similarity. To improve training efficiency, we precompute the baseline accuracy term Acc(G(Q, DRAG), A) and restrict training to examples where it equals 0. This effectively
filters out questions already solvable by naïve RAG,
allowing s3 to focus on harder queries where improved retrieval is essential for generation success.
3.3 Search Policy Optimization
We optimize the search policy πs3 via reinforcement learning using the Gain Beyond RAG (GBR)
reward. Each rollout consists of a complete search
trajectory: emitted queries, document selections,
and a stop decision. Once the final context Ds3 is
constructed, the generator G produces an answer,
and the GBR reward is computed. The generator
remains frozen; gradients are backpropagated only
through the search policy. Our method is agnostic
to the specific advantage estimation algorithm. In
this work, we use Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) due to its strong empirical stability (Jiang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025).
The PPO objective is:

Table 1: Performance comparison on general-domain QA datasets. Datasets marked with †
are the source of training data
used by Search-R1 and s3. We show generation accuracy (§4.1) as the main results, and exact match scores in brackets. We
use E5-base-v2 as the retriever and Wikipedia-2018 as the corpus. “Searcher” shows the number of parameters of the searcher
model. “#Train” shows the amount of training data used to train the searcher. DeepRetrievalBM25 is trained on NQ, Search-R1
and s3 are trained on NQ+HotpotQA with different training size (170k vs 2.4k). Results are averaged by three runs.
Evaluation Flow of Generation Accuracy
Input: Prediction p, Gold Answers A
Step 1: Normalize p and A (lowercase, remove punctuation and articles).
Step 2: span_check → If any a ∈ A is a token span
in p, return GenAcc = 1.
Step 3: judge_check → Prompt LLM: “Does p contain any of A?”
Step 4: Return GenAcc = 1 if LLM says yes; else 0.
Why Exact Match Falls Short - An Example
Golden answer: "Barack Obama"
LLM response: "The 44th President of the
United States was Barack Obama."
Exact match: 0 (response ̸= golden)
Generation Accuracy: 1 (span_check succeeds)
We choose this metric because it better captures
semantic correctness and aligns more closely with
human judgment than traditional exact match (see
Appendix B for supporting evidence).
Datasets. Following prior study (Jin et al., 2025),
we construct the training set by combining samples from Natural Questions (NQ) and HotpotQA.
Since span_check may incorrectly accept answers
for questions with semantic negation (e.g., treating “not true” as matching “true”), we remove
all yes/no and true/false questions from the training set to ensure reliable reward signals. To focus training on harder examples, we filter out
samples where the generator LLM (Qwen2.5-14BInstruct) already produces a correct answer using
naïve RAG retrieval. This reduces the dataset size
from 169,615 to 70,286. As later shown in Figure 5, s3 rapidly converges within ∼15 training

Table 2: Performance on medical-domain QA datasets (Xiong et al., 2024), using Claude-3-Haiku as the generator. We
report judge_check as the primary metric (see §4.1), with exact match in brackets. Retrieval is performed with E5-base-v2 under
two corpus settings: Wikipedia-2018 and Wikipedia+PubMed+Textbook. s3 achieves the highest overall accuracy among all
retrieval-augmented methods in both settings. None of the methods is trained on medical data: DeepRetrievalBM25 is trained on
70k NQ, Search-R1 on 170k NQ+HotpotQA, and s3 on 2.4k NQ+HotpotQA. Results are averaged by three runs.
steps. For evaluation, we use the checkpoints at
step 20. Given a batch size of 120, this corresponds to approximately 2.4k training examples,
highlighting the data efficiency of our method. We
evaluate on six general-domain QA benchmarks:
NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi
et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultihopQA (Ho
et al., 2020), and Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022), as
well as MIRAGE (Xiong et al., 2024), a suite of
five medical-domain QA datasets.
Baselines. We compare s3 against a diverse set of
RAG systems: (1) End-to-End Fine-tuning. Fully
fine-tuned models that jointly retrieve and generate
using outcome-based RL or supervision: SearchR1 (3B/7B), SFT (3B), and R1 (7B) where 3B/7B
for SFT and R1 are based on Qwen2.5-3B/7BInstruct. (2) Static Retrieval+Frozen Generator.
Methods that retrieve documents using a fixed or
scripted strategy, then pass them to a frozen generator: RAG-BM25, RAG-E5: retrieval via BM25
or E5-base (Wang et al., 2022). DeepRetrievalBM25 (3B): RL-trained searcher optimizing recall,
paired with BM25. (3) Active Retrieval+Frozen
Generator. A diagnostic setting where we extract
the documents retrieved during a model’s reasoning trajectory and feed them to a frozen generator: Search-R1-3B/7B (Ret), IRCoT (7B/14B), and
Search-o1 (14B) all fall under this category, differing only in whether retrieval is learned (Search-R1)
or prompted (IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023b), Searcho1 (Li et al., 2025)). (4) s3. Our s3 trains only the
searcher using GBR and forwards selected documents to a frozen generator, with no fine-tuning.
We place more details in Appendix A.1.
Models for Training and Evaluation. Throughout all the training processes, we use Qwen2.5-7BInstruct (Yang et al., 2024) as the base searcher
LLM to train, and use Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct1
as
the frozen generator for both answer generation
and judge_check for reward computation. For
evaluation, we use Claude-3-Haiku as the LLM
for judge_check to ensure high evaluation quality.
We test three frozen generators: Qwen2.5-7b/14bInstruct and Claude-3-Haiku. Both training and
evaluation are conducted on five NVIDIA A100
80GB PCIe GPUs. RAGEN (Wang et al., 2025)
and VERL (Sheng et al., 2024) are used as the base
architecture for multi-turn RL training. We place
more details in Appendix A.2.
5 Results
We evaluate s3 across six general-domain and five
medical-domain QA benchmarks, with frozen generators ranging from Qwen2.5-7B/14B to Claude1
In this paper, we use “GPTQ-Int4” version of “Qwen2.5-
14B-Instruct” for its high efficiency. We deploy frozen LLMs
using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) for fast inference.

primary metric and provide detailed comparisons
across baselines, reward functions, and training
efficiency.
General Domain RAG Performance. Table 1
summarizes results across general QA datasets. s3
achieves the highest average accuracy of 58.9%,
outperforming all static, zero-shot, and end-to-end
tuned baselines. This is particularly notable given
its extreme data efficiency—trained on just 2.4k
examples, compared to 70k for DeepRetrieval and
170k for Search-R1.
Takeaway #1: Searcher-Only is better
than End-to-End Optimization for RAG
s3 consistently outperforms Search-R1 on
search quality, revealing that most of the performance gain in RAG stems from improving the search capability instead of aligning
generation outputs.
Compared to IRCoT-14B, which conducts zeroshot retrieval with 2× the parameter count, s3 gains
+4.6 points on average. Relative to Search-R1-7B
(Ret), which uses the same backbone, s3 improves
by +1.5 points while avoiding any generator tuning. These gains are consistent across both singlehop datasets (e.g., 70.0% on NQ) and multi-hop
datasets (e.g., 62.4% on HotpotQA), showing that
learned search behavior transfers across reasoning
complexity.
Medical Domain QA Performance. Table 2 reports performance on the MIRAGE suite (Xiong
et al., 2024) under both corpus settings. s3 achieves
the highest average accuracy (76.6%) when using
the combined Wikipedia+PubMed+Textbook corpus, surpassing all retrieval-augmented baselines.
Interestingly, while Search-R1 shows competitive scores on Wikipedia-only corpora, its performance deteriorates on richer corpora, indicating
overfitting to shallow heuristics or memorized formats. In contrast, s3 and DeepRetrieval remain
robust, with s3 achieving 81.5% on PubMedQA

and outperforming IRCoT across four of five tasks.
Takeaway #2: Searcher-Only Training
enables Domain Transfer
s3’s zero-shot success on medical QA, despite training only on general QA, suggests
that reinforcement-learned search skills generalize more reliably than generation-tuned
approaches.
Retrieval Behavior and Search Dynamics We analyze the effect of retrieval parameters (#retrieved
documents and #turns) in Table 3 and reward progression in Figure 5. s3 reaches peak performance
with (k=8, turns=3), and adding more turns or
broader retrieval brings limited improvement. This
indicates that the policy rapidly learns to emit focused and early queries, capturing most useful content without unnecessary expansion.
Training Efficiency Table 4 shows that it takes
20 PPO steps (2.4k examples) to train s3, while
Search-R1 requires 2,100 steps (170k examples).
Even accounting for the higher per-step cost due
to LLM-based reward computation, the total wallclock time is reduced by ∼33×. Moreover, s3
avoids retriever pretraining and operates with a
smaller 7B policy model, making it a practical
method for low-resource RL training. s3 achieves

Figure 6: Ablation study on s3 components. Each row corresponds to a different configuration of Retrieval:Selection:Turns =
8:3:3, 5:3:3, and 3:3:3. The first six columns report generation accuracy. “Begin with Search” refers to initializing the first
query with the original question. “Document Selection” refers to the selection step within the s3 loop (Step 3). We observe that
removing Begin with Search leads to a significant drop in performance. While removing Document Selection sometimes yields
better performance, the full s3 system still performs competitively—and most importantly, drastically reduces input token usage
(2.6× ∼ 4.2× less tokens), improving overall efficiency.

state-of-the-art performance with orders of magnitude less data and compute, suggesting a more
sustainable path for RAG optimization.
Reward Function Comparison Table 5 compares
different reward signals used for computing GBR.
LLMJudge provides slightly higher final scores,
but is too costly for scalable training. In contrast,
GenAcc offers strong performance while remaining
efficient and aligning better with human evaluation
than EM or span-based heuristics. Appendix B
shows that GenAcc matches human judgment on
96.4% of samples, while Exact Match used by
Search-R1 captures only 15.8%.
Takeaway #3: Reward Choice directly
shapes Search Quality
Using semantically or human preference
aligned metrics like our GenAcc (§4.1) encourages the search policy to retrieve substantively helpful documents, rather than
optimizing for brittle string overlap.
Effects of Selection and “Begin with Search”.
We investigate the role of two components in the s3
loop: document selection and initialization with the
original question (Begin with Search”). As shown
in Figure 6, removing the selection step degrades

performance on four out of six datasets. This is
expected, as passing all retrieved documents to the
generator increases token length, up to 4× with
k = 8, and introduces more noise. Still, performance improves slightly on NQ and 2Wiki, likely
because broader context benefits multi-hop reasoning or compensates for overly aggressive pruning.
Disabling “Begin with Search” consistently causes
a significant drop, underscoring the importance
of seeding the search process with a strong initial query. Interestingly, when both selection and
initialization are removed, performance recovers
slightly compared to removing only initialization.
This suggests that selection and initialization interact conditionally—selection may amplify the
downsides of poor initialization by prematurely
filtering out useful context.
6 Conclusion
We present s3, a framework that trains a searchonly agent using the Gain Beyond RAG reward. By
decoupling search from generation and optimizing
only the retriever, s3 outperforms strong baselines
with just 2.4k examples. Our results show that
targeted search policy learning yields substantial
gains in both efficiency and generalization, offering
a scalable path for improving RAG systems.

7 Limitations
While s3 demonstrates strong empirical performance with remarkable data efficiency, several limitations warrant discussion.
Dependency on Frozen Generators. Our framework assumes the availability of a capable frozen
generator LLM. Although this enables modelagnostic training, it implicitly relies on the generator’s ability to make use of improved context.
For lower-capacity or instruction-weak generators,
the gains from better retrieval may not fully translate into better outputs.
Reward Estimation Bottleneck. The use of
generation-based rewards such as GenAcc necessitates LLM inference during training to compute
reward signals. This introduces computational overhead compared to token-level or retrieval-only objectives, limiting scalability. Although we show
that s3 achieves high performance with minimal
steps, online reward computation remains more
costly than offline retrieval optimization.
Broader Impacts. On the positive side, s3 reduces the data and compute burden for training
effective retrieval agents, making RAG systems
more accessible to low-resource communities. It
may also benefit domains such as healthcare or scientific QA where labeled data is scarce. However,
like all retrieval-augmented systems, s3 inherits
the biases of both its searcher and generator. If
deployed without careful curation of source corpora, it may propagate misinformation or reflect
existing societal biases. We encourage practitioners to audit both retrieval sources and downstream
outputs when applying this framework in sensitive
domains.
Overall, while s3 advances the state of searchagent training, further work is needed to address
these limitations and ensure safe, robust deployment in real-world settings.

A Implementation Details
For static retrieval baselines running on MIRAGE, we use the question itself instead of question+options to retrieve.
A.1 Baselines Details
IRCoT (7B and 14B). IRCoT2
(Trivedi et al.,
2023b) is a prompting-based method that alternates
between chain-of-thought reasoning and retrieval.
It requires no fine-tuning: the model is instructed
via prompt to iteratively reason about a question
and issue retrieval queries, integrating newly retrieved evidence into its reasoning process. We
apply IRCoT using both Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.
DeepRetrieval-BM25-3B (Jiang et al., 2025).
This baseline employs a 3B-parameter language
model trained with reinforcement learning on retrieval metrics such as recall and NDCG. It learns to
generate search queries that maximize the retrieval
of relevant documents using a BM25 search engine.
Training is conducted on 70k QA examples in NQ
dataset with answer span reward (evidence-seeking
task in (Jiang et al., 2025)), focusing exclusively
on improving retrieval performance, not generation.
We use its publicly released checkpoint3
.
Search-R1-3B and Search-R1-7B (Jin et al.,
2025). These baselines4 use 3B and 7B parameter
models, respectively, and are trained end-to-end to
jointly retrieve and generate answers. Reinforcement learning is applied on 170k training examples,
using an exact match (EM) reward to guide both
retrieval query formulation and answer generation.

The model directly integrates search results into its
reasoning steps within a single retrieval round.
Search-o1. Search-o1 (Li et al., 2025) is an
inference-time retrieval controller designed to enhance long-form reasoning in o1-style models such
as QwQ and OpenAI’s o1-preview. It is not trained
with reinforcement learning or fine-tuned at all.
Instead, Search-o1 leverages frozen LLMs and augments them with retrieval by prompting the model
to emit search queries mid-reasoning, enclosed in
special tokens (e.g., <|begin_search_query|>...
Retrieved documents are then post-processed using a Reason-in-Documents module before being
injected back into the reasoning flow.
RAG-BM25 and RAG-E5 (Lewis et al., 2020).
These are naive retrieval-augmented generation
baselines with no model training. RAG-BM25 uses
top-k documents retrieved from a BM25 index,
while RAG-E5 retrieves passages using dense retrieval based on E5 embeddings. In both settings,
the retrieved documents are prepended to the input
prompt and fed into a frozen generator LLM. We
set k = 3, following prior study (Lin et al., 2023b;
Jin et al., 2025).
SFT and R1. On general-domain RAG datasets,
we train an SFT model with Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
using the same dataset as Search-R1’s 170k
NQ+HotpotQA with TRL (von Werra et al., 2020)
framework. R1 is the “no search” version of SearchR1 (Jin et al., 2025), replicating Deepseek-R1-
Zero (Guo et al., 2025) with a small LLM. We
use its publicly released checkpoint5
.
CoT (Wei et al., 2022) and Direct Inference. CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) prompting instructs the LLM
to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing an answer, without any external retrieval.
Direct Inference simply feeds the raw question into
the LLM. Neither baseline involves any form of
training or finetuning.
To ensure a fair comparison, we set the maximum number of turns to 4 and limit the context to
3 documents per turn for all multi-turn baselines
(IRCoT, Search-R1, and Search-o1) and s3, aligning with prior study (Jin et al., 2025).
A.2 Setup Details
Hardware. All training and evaluation processes
are run on five NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe on a system with an AMD EPYC 7513 32-Core Processor
and 1.0 TB of RAM.

hotpotqa_train-qwen2.5-7b-em-ppo-v0.2

Software. We built s3 using Python 3.9, leveraging
the VERL framework (Sheng et al., 2024)
6
(v0.1)
as the backbone for reinforcement learning with
language models, and RAGEN (Wang et al., 2025)
7
as the underlying multi-turn RL architecture. Our
implementation uses vLLM (v0.8.5) (Kwon et al.,
2023) for fast LLM inference and evaluation, PyTorch (v2.4.0) with CUDA 12.1 for deep learning,
and Ray (Moritz et al., 2018) for distributed training and serving. To improve performance, we integrate Flash Attention 2 (Dao, 2023) for efficient attention computation, PySerini (v0.22.1) (Lin et al.,
2021) for retrieval and evaluation, and FAISS-GPU
(v1.7.2) (Douze et al., 2024) for high-speed dense
retrieval.
Model parameters. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-7BInstruct using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
via VERL. Training is conducted with a total batch
size of 120, using micro-batches of size 15 for the
actor and 10 for the critic, and a rollout temperature of 0.6. The actor and critic learning rates
are set to 1 × 10−6
and 1 × 10−5
, respectively,
with no warm-up for the actor and a 1% warmup ratio for the critic. Both models use gradient
checkpointing and parameter offloading to reduce
memory overhead. Following prior work (Jin et al.,
2025), we adopt XFORMERS (Lefaudeux et al.,
2022) as the attention backend in vLLM and enable state masking to prevent incorrect supervision signals. KL regularization is applied with a
coefficient of 0.001. For answer generation and
LLM-based judge_check during training, we run
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int48 on a dedicated
A100 80GB GPU with vLLM. The retriever (E5-
base) is deployed alongside PySerini on the same
five GPUs used for PPO training. The context window is set to 8,000 tokens, with a maximum of
1,400 tokens allocated to the top-k retrieved documents per turn.
A.3 Datasets & Corpora
Datasets. We evaluate on six general-domain QA
datasets and five medical-domain QA datasets.
General-domain datasets include Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al.,
2022), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultihopQA (Ho et al., 2020), and Musique (Trivedi

5-14B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4
et al., 2022). 9
For medical-domain, we adopt the MIRAGE
benchmark (Xiong et al., 2024), which includes five datasets: MedQA-US (Jin et al.,
2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), PubMedQA* (Jin et al., 2019), BioASQ-Y/N (Tsatsaronis et al., 2015; Krithara et al., 2023), and
MMLU-Med (Hendrycks et al., 2020).10
Corpora. For general-domain QA, we follow
prior work (Jin et al., 2025) and use the Wikipedia
2018 dump (Karpukhin et al., 2020) as the sole
knowledge source.11 For medical-domain QA,
we evaluate under two corpus settings: (1) the
Wikipedia 2018 dump (Karpukhin et al., 2020)
alone, and (2) a composite biomedical corpus introduced by (Xiong et al., 2024), which combines
Wikipedia, PubMed, and textbook documents to
provide broader domain coverage.12
Use of Artifacts. All datasets and models are
used strictly within research contexts, consistent
with their intended use and licensing. Our derived
artifacts (e.g., retrieved documents, trained models)
are likewise restricted to non-commercial academic
use.
A.4 Generation Accuracy Computation
To evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval strategies in improving answer generation, we adopt
a composite metric called Generation Accuracy
(GenAcc), which is designed to better reflect semantic correctness than surface-form exact match.
Overview. Given a model prediction p and a set
of gold answers A, GenAcc is defined in Eq. 3.
This metric returns 1 if either a string-normalized
token span of any a ∈ A is found within p, or if a
frozen LLM judge deems the answer semantically
correct. It returns 0 otherwise.
1. Span-Based Matching. We first apply a deterministic span check using normalized string comparison. Specifically, we:

//huggingface.co/MedRAG.
13
• Convert both prediction and gold answers to
lowercase.
• Remove punctuation and articles (a, an, the).
• Apply whitespace normalization.
We then use a tokenizer to compare whether any token span in the prediction matches any normalized
gold answer. If a match is found, the score is 1.
Examples:
• Success Case:
Prediction: "The 44th President of the
United States was Barack Obama."
Gold Answer: "Barack Obama"
Result: Span match succeeds because the normalized gold answer is a token span in the prediction.
• Failure Case (Negation):
Prediction: "That statement is not true."
Gold Answer: "true"
Result: Span match incorrectly succeeds due
to token overlap, despite the semantic meaning
being opposite. We exclude such yes/no cases
from training to avoid this issue.
• Failure Case (Paraphrase):
Prediction: "He led the civil rights
movement in the 1960s."
Gold Answer: "Martin Luther King Jr."
Result: Span match fails because the gold answer
does not appear verbatim in the response, even
though the answer is implied.
2. LLM-Based Semantic Judging. If the
span check fails (0), we invoke a lightweight
correctness check using a frozen LLM (e.g.,
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4 for training
or Claude-3-Haiku for evaluation). We prompt
the model with:
Please check if any of the golden answers
is contained in the following response:
{p}
Golden answers: {str(A)}
Directly answer with ’yes’ or ’no’.
If the LLM outputs yes, we consider the prediction
correct and set the score to 1.
Examples:
• Success Case (Numerical Format):
Prediction: "The answer is twenty-five."
Gold Answer: "25"
Result: Span match fails due to different formats,
but the LLM outputs yes based on numerical
equivalence.
• Success Case (Units and Symbols):
Prediction: "It weighs 3 kilograms."
Gold Answer: "3 kg"
Result: Span match fails due to token mismatch,
but the LLM recognizes them as equivalent and
answers yes.
• Failure Case (Incorrect Entity):
Prediction: "The capital of France is
Marseille."
Gold Answer: "Paris"
Result: Span match fails, and the LLM also outputs no, indicating semantic disagreement.
Motivation. This design avoids brittle behavior
from exact match metrics and aligns more closely
with human judgments. For instance, if the gold
answer is "Einstein" and the model prediction is
"Albert Einstein was the scientist who developed
the theory of relativity", our metric returns 1, while
exact match fails due to surface mismatch. Empirically, GenAcc matches human labels on 96.4%
of samples (see Appendix B), whereas EM only
achieves 15.8%.
Implementation. The full reward computing
pipeline is implemented through the following components:
• span_check: This function (1) normalizes both
prediction and gold answers by applying casefolding, punctuation and article removal, and
whitespace normalization; and (2) performs
token-level span matching using a tokenizer. This
step follows the evaluation strategy introduced
in prior work (Ma et al., 2021) and leverages the
has_answer utility from PySerini13
.
• judge_check: If the span check fails, this fallback invokes a frozen LLM to assess whether the
prediction semantically entails any gold answer.
The LLM is prompted to respond with a binary
judgment ("yes" or "no").
• check_answer_correct: This function coordinates the evaluation process. It first applies span_check; if that fails, it falls back to
judge_check for semantic validation. Note: For
the medical RAG benchmark (MIRAGE (Xiong
et al., 2024)) evaluation, we exclusively use
judge_check, as most questions are multiplechoice and span_check can incorrectly accept
wrong answers due to its strict matching criteria.
13https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/
master/pyserini/eval/evaluate_dpr_retrieval.py
14
This hybrid strategy combines the efficiency of
lexical matching with the robustness of LLM-based
semantic evaluation, ensuring reliable and scalable
answer correctness assessment.
A.5 Document Extraction Logic
We extract document titles and texts from information blocks using a structured approach that
prioritizes important documents. Our extraction
algorithm processes text with the following format:
<information>
Doc 1 (Title: "Document Title 1") ...
Doc 2 (Title: "Document Title 2") ...
</information>
<important_info>
[1, 3]
</important_info>
The algorithm follows these key rules:
• <important_info> tags apply only to the most
recent <information> block
• If no <important_info> tag exists for a
<information> block, all documents from that
block are included
• Documents are deduplicated based on content
The implementation uses regular expressions to:
1. Identify all information blocks and important
document tags
2. Associate each important info tag with its corresponding information block
3. Extract document IDs, titles, and text content
4. Filter documents based on importance markers
The document pattern is matched using a regex that
handles variations in spacing and optional quotes
around titles. Our implementation includes appropriate error handling to manage parsing failures
and maintains the original order of documents. The
algorithm has O(n) time complexity where n is
the input string length, with additional factors related to the number of documents and information
blocks.
B Human Alignment Study of Evaluation
Metrics (GenAcc and EM)
To assess the alignment of our primary evaluation
metric, Generation Accuracy, with human judgment, we conducted a human annotation study. We
Human Evaluation Instruction
You are an evaluator for question-answering
systems. Your task is to determine whether
the system-generated answer aligns with the
provided gold (reference) answers.
Evaluation Criteria: An answer should be
marked as correct (1) if it:
• Contains the same key information as
the golden answers;
• Expresses the same meaning, even if
using different wording;
• Is factually consistent with the golden
answers.
Please input only:
• "1" if the system’s answer aligns with
the golden answers;
• "0" if it does not.

generation.
randomly sampled 1,000 answer generations from
the general-domain QA test set. Each sample was
labeled as Correct (1) or Incorrect (0) by human annotators, consisting of two Ph.D. students
and one M.S. student majoring in computer science
who evenly divided the annotation workload. Figure 7 shows the instruction, and the anonymous
sheet14 shows the raw results.
We then compared these human labels against
the binary decisions made by Generation Accuracy and Exact Match. As shown in Figure 8, Generation Accuracy demonstrates strong alignment
with human evaluation, correctly identifying 96.4%
of answers that were judged correct by humans. In
contrast, Exact Match only captures 15.8% of such
answers, largely due to its strict reliance on string
matching.
These results confirm that Generation Accuracy
is a more reliable and human-aligned metric, especially for evaluating free-form and abstractive
answers where surface forms may differ despite

methods (Song et al., 2025).
C Prompts
To train and evaluate the s3 framework effectively,
we design three system prompts targeting distinct
modules: the search policy (Searcher), answer generation, and judge-based evaluation. Each prompt
is carefully constructed to ensure modularity, interpretability, and compatibility with frozen LLMs.
Searcher Prompt. The prompt for the Searcher
(Figure 11) guides a trained policy to perform structured multi-turn search. It defines a loop-based
instruction set that mimics real-world decisionmaking: the model emits a search query, inspects
results, selects key documents, and decides whether
to continue searching. This design supports iterative refinement and selection via:
• <query>: the generated search query in JSON
format.
• <information>: the retrieved documents returned by the search engine.
• <important_info>: a subset of documents
deemed most relevant (up to 3).
• <search_complete>: a binary decision on
whether to stop searching.
Importantly, only selected documents in
<important_info> are visible to the generator, encouraging the policy to focus on high-quality

behavior from generation, this prompt allows
reinforcement learning with a frozen black-box
LLM using downstream answer quality as a
reward.
Answer Generation Prompt. Figure 12 shows
the prompt used for final answer generation. It provides the accumulated context from selected documents along with the user’s original question. The
generator is instructed to produce a direct, succinct
answer without verbosity. This format simplifies
reward computation and ensures generation outputs
are consistent and easy to evaluate.
Judge_Check Prompt. To enable scalable, automated evaluation during training and inference, we
employ a lightweight correctness prompt shown
in Figure 13. This prompt asks an LLM to verify
whether any gold answer appears in the predicted
response. Unlike brittle exact-match metrics, this
approach captures semantically valid completions
even if they differ in surface form. During training, a quantized Qwen2.5-14B model is used for
cost-effective inference, while evaluation employs
Claude-3-Haiku for higher reliability.
Together, these prompts form a coherent pipeline
that supports modular training and evaluation of
retrieval-augmented generation systems. The clear
separation of roles allows s3 to focus learning
solely on the search agent, and our prompt designs
play a key role in realizing this clean decoupling.
D Scalability Study
While s3 demonstrates strong performance with
just 20 training steps (i.e., 2.4k examples), we investigate how performance evolves with additional
data and training. Specifically, we train the “5-3-4”
configuration for up to 300 steps.
Figure 9 shows the reward curve over training
steps. We observe a consistent upward trend, indicating that the search policy continues to improve
with more data and training iterations.
To quantify this improvement, Figure 10 compares the model’s QA performance at step 20 and
step 300 across six datasets. The results show that
s3 scales gracefully: most datasets exhibit steady
gains, with improvements particularly noticeable
on PopQA, HotpotQA, and Musique.
These findings suggest that s3 can also benefit from larger-scale training, making it a flexible
framework that performs well both in low-resource
and high-resource settings.

Prompt Instructions for Searcher
You are a search copilot for a generation model. Based on a user’s query and initial searched results, you will first
determine if the searched results are enough to produce an answer.
If the searched results are enough, you will use <search_complete>True</search_complete> to indicate that you
have gathered enough information for the generation model to produce an answer.
If the searched results are not enough, you will go through a loop of <query> → <information> → <important_info>
→ <search_complete> → <query> (if not complete) ..., to help the generation model to generate a better answer with
more relevant information searched.
You should show the search query between <query> and </query> in JSON format.
Based on the search query, we will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You
need to put the doc ids of the important documents (up to 3 documents, within the current information window) between
<important_info> and </important_info> (e.g., <important_info>[1, 4]</important_info>).
A search query must be followed by a <search_complete> tag if the search is not complete.
After reviewing the information, you must decide whether to continue searching with a new query or indicate that the
search is complete. If you need more information, use <search_complete>False</search_complete>. Otherwise,
use <search_complete>True</search_complete> to terminate the search.
Note: Only the content between <important_info> will be used by the generation model to produce an answer.
